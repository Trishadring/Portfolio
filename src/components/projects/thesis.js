        I set out to find solutions to the current traffic that results from HFA kids

        I went through a process of documenting,

      <h2 className="">CCS &amp; HFA Questionnaire</h2>
      <p className="explain">
        I made three different fliers to hand out. I made one for CCS, and two
        different ones for HFA. For CCS students I handed some out personally,
        left a few around campus, but most of my traffic was from posting on
        Facebook, emailing the link to all GD students, and getting into the weekly
        CCS email. For HFA I handed all of my fliers out directly to students
        during dismissal. I also emailed various employees of HFA asking
        them to fill out my survey as well as sending my survey to their students,
        but with no&nbsp;luck.

      <h2 className="">Responses</h2>
      <p className="explain">
        Throughout the survey, there were some common themes among the answers
        I got. Most students fears for their safety and for the safety of the
        HFA&nbsp;students.

          "In addition to the excessive traffic, there seems to be a pretty serious
          hazard for the kids. Kids are running into the street in front of traffic to
          get across the street to their ride. I have seen several near&nbsp;misses."

        <p className="responce">
          "I've almost been hit repeatedly trying to cross Baltimore (walking)
          because people have sped around others (driving the wrong way down
          the lanes). At one point I tripped and fell (skinned my knees) trying to get
          out of the way of someone speeding past a car that was parked in the
          driving&nbsp;lane."

        <p className="responce">
          "The kids will also run around outside all over the place making it dangerous

          "I think there's no good system forthe kids at HFA to be picked up so

        <p className="responce">
          "While actually driving through thetraffic takes quite some time and
          can be a hassle. I think the biggerissue is the safety of students trying
          to cross the street to get to theparking garage. I could never figure
          out why no one has put a crosswalkto the parking&nbsp;structure."

      <hr/>
      <div className="d-flex flex-wrap">
        <p className="responce">
          CCS students walking from the parking structure to the main entrance
          also causes traffic delays. There is no crosswalk, and the doors closest
          to the crosswalks are locked during most hours, discouraging college
          students from using&nbsp;them.
        </p>
        <p className="responce">
          Currently, the people who use the free street parking are employees at
          the state building or in&nbsp;Shinola.

      <h2 className="">Proposed Solutions</h2>
      <p className="explain">
        After reading case studies from government agencies and design firms I used
        solutions other schools have used along with other things to come up with these
        six things to implement at the&nbsp;school.

            1. Expand the current loading zone for&nbsp;parents.
          </h3>
          <p>
            To do this there needs to be restrictions on the parking lot on Cass. This is the
            safest area for HFA kids to get picked up but this parking lot on most days is
            completely full. A two-hour time limit during weekdays is&nbsp;recommended.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div className="responce">
          <h3 className="eyebrow">
            2. Establish a crosswalk from the parking structure to the main
            entrance for college&nbsp;students.
          </h3>
          <p>
            A major concern for safety among college students is walking to the
            parking structure. There is currently no&nbsp;crosswalk.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div className="responce">
          <h3 className="eyebrow">
            3. Restrict street parking on W Baltimore. Implement parking
            meters with a two-hour&nbsp;limit.
          </h3>
          <p>
            The people parking here are people working in the area. This results in most
            parking spots being full most of the day. Putting a parking meter or restricting
            parking during school hours would open up the spots for parents to safely pick
            up their&nbsp;child.

            4. Employ crossing guards near loading zones direct parents and to
            keep traffic&nbsp;moving.

            5. Designate parking spaces for carpooling&nbsp;parents.
          </h3>
          <p>
            Encouraging carpooling is an important way to cut down on the number of cars
            picking up children at a time. Giving carpooling parents a designated area
            acts as an&nbsp;incentive.

            6. Parents and students all need to be educated about this&nbsp;change.
          </h3>
          <p>
            Faculty, security, and administration have to take appropriate steps
            to enforce the new and current rules. The problem can not be solved unless
            everyone is willing to contribute to ensuring the safety of our&nbsp;students.
