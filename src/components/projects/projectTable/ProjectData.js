There were tons of resources that would show you what bug or fish you could catch that month but nothing that would filter it by the current time.</br> To filter the site you can choose between fish or bugs then choose the hemisphere that you picked for your game. I even added a feature to hide the creatures that you have already caught in the game to narrow the list down to what you have still to catch.There was no api to pull from so I created my own json mini database to work with.
